# Python Turtle Snowflake

We started off with this Raspberry Pi tutorial as a jumping off point: https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/turtle-snowflakes

I did this with my four-year-old, Samuel. He chose the name for the turtle (Slow Poke) as well as the colors that the snowflakes appear as. 

Rather than go with the challenge prompt of random snowflakes of random sizes, we went for an seasonally appropriate-to-winter wreath shape.

Result:
